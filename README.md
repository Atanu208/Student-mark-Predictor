# ðŸŽ“ Student Mark Predictor

The **Student Mark Predictor** is a machine learning project that predicts studentsâ€™ future marks based on their past performance and study patterns. It helps students and educators identify areas for improvement early.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

* Predicts marks using inputs such as:

  * Previous exam scores
  * Attendance percentage
  * Study hours
  * Assignment completion rate
* Built with **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)** for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
* Implements multiple regression algorithms and selects the best-performing model.
* Flask-based web app interface to input student data and display predicted marks.
* Clean modular code for data handling, model training, and predictions.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* **Backend/ML:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
* **Web Framework:** Flask
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Collect student-related data (scores, attendance, study hours, assignments).
2. Train regression models on the dataset.
3. Evaluate models and choose the best one.
4. Enter new student data via Flask web app.
5. Get predicted marks instantly.
